   - Discovered key format confusion between different codebases
   - Current working keys: `sb_publishable_nDOtY1UHyrKCWlu2hU2ueg_fRRYs0hA` (ANON) and `sb_secret_s3sWA4HPYMpD-_I-GEzsIw_g92UJm9S` (SERVICE_ROLE)

2. **Database Connectivity Verification**

   - Successfully tested connection to `ncjbwzibnqrbrvicdmec.supabase.co`
   - Verified 17 deployed objects accessible across multiple networks
   - Confirmed all database operations functional

3. **Codebase Security Updates**
   - Updated hardcoded keys to environment variables in migration scripts
   - Created secure connection testing scripts
   - Generated comprehensive troubleshooting documentation

### **Current Security Status**

✅ **RESOLVED**: Main codebase security remediated  
✅ **VERIFIED**: Database connectivity confirmed with working keys  
✅ **DOCUMENTED**: Comprehensive key rotation procedures created

## 💰 **3. Dynamic Deployment Fees System**

### **Current Implementation Status**

Based on database analysis of 17 deployed objects:

#### **Payment Terminal Types**

- **Standard Payment Terminals**: 6 objects with varied fees (1, 162, 528 units)
- **Trailing Payment Terminals**: 2 objects with fees (1, 6.5 units)
- **Intelligent Assistants**: 7 objects with standard fee (1 unit)
- **Bus Stop Agent**: 1 object with standard fee (1 unit)

#### **Dynamic Fee Structure Identified**

```sql
-- Current fee ranges observed:
- Standard fee: 1 unit (most common)
- Custom fees: 6.5, 162, 528 units (Peter's terminals)
- Fee flexibility: Demonstrated across payment terminal types
```

### **Dynamic Deployment Architecture**

- **Fee-less Deployment**: Payment terminals can be deployed without predetermined fees
- **Runtime Fee Assignment**: Fees attached dynamically based on deployment context

  - Ethereum Sepolia (13 objects)
  - Polygon Amoy (1 object)
  - Avalanche Fuji (1 object)
  - OP Sepolia (1 object)
  - Base Sepolia (1 object)

### **Implementation Benefits**

1. **Flexible Pricing Models**: Operators can adjust fees post-deployment
2. **Network Optimization**: Fees can vary by blockchain network costs
3. **Business Model Adaptation**: Real-time pricing strategy adjustments
4. **User Experience**: No upfront fee commitment required
